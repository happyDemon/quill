# Quill

Quill is a portable discussion helper, that does most of the heavy lifting if you want to maintain discussion around your site.
Why should you have a seperate comment system for your blog's comments and product reviews? There's no need to duplicate the functionality needed to manage them.

All that's left for you is to implement the templates and permissions needed to show and handle your discussions.
